Heart Disease Prediction Project 
-------------------------------- 
Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Heart Disease Dataset)
Rows: 303
Features: 13 original features (after preprocessing → scaled, encoded, cleaned)
Target: Binary classification (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)

Steps Overview:
---------------
Step 1 — Data Loading & Preprocessing
    - Handled missing values (ca, thal).
    - Encoded categorical features.
    - Applied feature scaling.
    - Outlier detection and visualization.

Step 2 — PCA (Visualization only)
    - Reduced dataset to 2D/3D for visualization.
    - Showed clear separation between disease and non-disease groups.

Step 3 — Feature Selection
    - Applied Chi-Square, RFE, and Feature Importance.
    - Selected most relevant predictors for final models.

Step 4 — Supervised Learning
    Models Evaluated:
        1. Logistic Regression → Accuracy ~ 0.836
        2. KNN → Accuracy ~ 0.918
        3. Decision Tree → Accuracy ~ 0.869
        4. Random Forest → Accuracy ~ 0.918
        5. SVM → Accuracy ~ 0.852

Step 5 — Unsupervised Learning
    - Applied K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering.
    - Used PCA for visualization of clusters.
    - Helped to explore natural grouping in data.

Step 6 — Hyperparameter Tuning
    - Optimized models with GridSearchCV.
    - Best performing models after tuning:
        * Random Forest → Accuracy ~ 0.85
        * KNN → Accuracy ~ 0.80
        * SVM → Accuracy ~ 0.88

Final Notes:
------------
- Preprocessing (scaling + encoding) was critical for SVM & Logistic Regression.
- Random Forest and SVM delivered the best balanced performance.
- KNN initially performed very well before tuning.
- Unsupervised learning provided insights but not as strong as supervised models.
- Final pipeline (data + model) can be saved for deployment.
